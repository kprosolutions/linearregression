# Linear Regression
Linear Regression is type of stastical modeling technique used to establish relationship between independent variables/predictors and dependent variable/target/response.

There are two types in Linear Regression
  
  1. Simple Linear Regression(SLR): This is used to find relationship between two variables, One is predictor or independent variable and        other is response or dependent variable.
     
     Below are the pre-requisites for simple linear regression.
      i. The dependent variable Y has a linear relationship to the independent variable X. To check this, make sure that the XY scatterplot          is linear.
      
     ii. For each value of X, the probability distribution of Y has the same standard deviation Ïƒ. When this condition is satisfied, the            variability of the residuals will be relatively constant across all values of X
    
    iii. For any given value of X,
          The Y values are independent, as indicated by a random pattern on the residual plot.
          The Y values are roughly normally distributed (i.e., symmetric and unimodal). A little skewness is ok if the sample size is                 large. A histogram or a dotplot will show the shape of the distribution.
          
  2. Multiple Linear Regression(MLR): This is used to find relationship between multiple independent variables and single dependent              variable.
